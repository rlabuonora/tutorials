```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
mtcars2 <- mutate(mtcars, am =factor(am), cyl = factor(cyl))
p <- ggplot(mtcars2, aes(x = wt, y = hp, col = am)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
p

```

Extend p with a scale_x_continuous() with limits = c(3, 6) and expand = c(0, 0). What do you see?

```{r}
p + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(3,6), expand = c(0, 0))
p + coord_cartesian(xlim = c(3,6))
```
